Hi, I'm Shubham Agrawal and I work as a Data Analyst. I hold a Bachelor's
degree in Computer Science and Engineering from JSSATE, Noida. I am good at SQL, Python and Dashboarding.

My idea behind taking up Computer Science and Engineering is my love for programming and the fact that,
given the knowledge, I can make a computer do almost anything I want it to do.

Since I was young, I have always enjoyed to solve puzzles and mathematical problems.
So that's how I look at big data sets as big number puzzle which I want to solve. Finding patterns
nobody else sees is the challenge to me.

Before I started as a Data Analyst, I had worked as a freelance teacher helping students in resolving
their maths and physics queries.

I recently expanded my skill set to topics including Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, DT and RF,
and I am always excited to keep learning new methods in a challenging and fast-paced environment.

My hobby is Calesthenics and I am crazy about exploring this wonderful planet! 

Few keywords that define me are:-
- Passionate
- Meticulous
- Logical
- Thoughtful
- INCREDIBLE

I am firm believer of passion and determination can lead you to success.

If you'd like me to get involved with helping your business grow, I'm all ears!
